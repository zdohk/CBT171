Sam,
This is a pair of DL/I utilities.
This is in the TRANSMIT/FTP format.

They were intended to be an IMS version independent back-up/restore.
DLIUNLD will read any IMS DL/I data base with segments up to 32744 bytes
long.

DLIUNLD has been run and tested.

DLILOAD was never needed and has not been tested.

  Later note from Richard about DLILOAD:
    I finally heard from someone that tried using DLILOAD.
    There were a couple of bugs.  They have been corrected.

Both utilities keep statistics.  The statistics on a load should match
the statistics for the un-load.
